<h1>Karma Ramp</h1>
<span><b>Style</b>: Control</span>
<span><b>Champion(s)</b> : Karma, Braum</span>
<span>The idea of the deck is making Karma faster to play the reason Braum is in this deck becus I tried a lot of champion from Freljod
    and it didn't work out even Anivia becus the curve and Braum is easier to play before Enlighted.
